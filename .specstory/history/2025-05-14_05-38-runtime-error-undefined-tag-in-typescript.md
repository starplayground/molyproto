Let me check the ChatPanel.tsx file to fix the undefined `tag` variable error.

---

Read file: client/src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx

---

I see the issue. In the `NotePromptCard` component, the variable `tag` is being referenced on line 27 before it's defined. The code extracts the match but doesn't actually assign the tag variable.

Let me fix this:

---

```diff
    // Extract the tag from the title (it should be in the format 【tag】)
    const tagMatch = title.match(/【(.+?)】/);
+   const tag = tagMatch ? tagMatch[1] : null;
    
    // Extract the tag from the title using our updated format
```

---

The error has been fixed. The issue was that the code was extracting the tag using `title.match(/【(.+?)】/)` but wasn't assigning the extraction to a variable named `tag`. 

I added the line:
```typescript
const tag = tagMatch ? tagMatch[1] : null;
```

This extracts the first capture group from the regex match (the content between the 【】 characters) and assigns it to the `tag` variable, or sets it to null if no match is found. Now the code should run without throwing the "tag is not defined" error.
